## How Azure AI Search Can Help Optimize Embedding Performance

> Azure AI Search doesn’t generate embeddings from third-party models, but it **amplifies their value** through advanced indexing, retrieval, and hybrid search capabilities.

> [!TIP]
> Use Azure AI Foundry to experiment with multiple embedding models and benchmark their performance before committing to production.

<details>
<summary><b>Vector Search Capabilities</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Azure AI Search supports robust vector search features that allow you to fully leverage embeddings generated externally (e.g., from OpenAI, Voyage, Cohere):

- Accepts **custom embeddings** from any model, making it agnostic and flexible across providers.
- Supports **semantic similarity search** using metrics like cosine similarity and dot product, enabling nuanced matching beyond keyword overlap.
- Handles **large-scale indexing** and **low-latency retrieval**, ideal for enterprise-grade applications with millions of documents.
- Integrates with **hybrid search pipelines**, combining vector and keyword search to improve both precision and recall.

> Example Use Cases:

- Intelligent document retrieval for legal or financial archives.
- FAQ matching and chatbot grounding using semantic similarity.
- Product recommendation systems based on user intent embeddings.

<summary><b>Performance Optimization Tips</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> To maximize efficiency and relevance in embedding-based search, consider these strategies:

1. **Choose embedding size wisely**: Smaller embeddings (e.g., 512–1024) reduce latency and storage costs, ideal for mobile or real-time apps.
2. **Batch embedding generation**: Pre-process documents in bulk to reduce API calls and improve throughput.
3. **Use domain-specific models**: Models like `voyage-finance-2` or `voyage-law-2` yield better semantic relevance in specialized contexts.
4. **Monitor vector DB costs**: Larger embeddings increase storage and query costs, balance precision with efficiency.
5. **Leverage hybrid search**: Combine keyword and vector search to handle both exact and fuzzy matches, especially in noisy datasets.
6. **Normalize and deduplicate embeddings**: Ensure consistent vector quality and avoid redundant indexing.

<details>
<summary><b>Integration Strategy</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Azure AI Search is designed to integrate seamlessly with external embedding pipelines. Here's how to build a modular and scalable setup:

- **Generate embeddings externally** using models from Azure OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-3-small`), Voyage AI (`voyage-3`, `voyage-multilingual-2`), or Cohere (`embed-v3` series).
- **Store embeddings** in Azure AI Search vector fields, which are optimized for fast similarity search and scalable indexing.
- **Query using embedded vectors** to perform semantic matching, enabling intelligent document retrieval, contextual search, and RAG workflows.
- **Automate updates**: Use Azure Functions or Logic Apps to refresh embeddings when documents change, keeping your index up-to-date.

> Example Workflow:

1. Use `text-embedding-3-large` to embed support tickets.
2. Store vectors in Azure AI Search.
3. Query with user questions to retrieve semantically similar tickets.
4. Combine with keyword filters for precision.
